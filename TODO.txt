### QUESTIONS ###
* Can some lanterns be destroyed, like the ghost lantern ? How many HP ?
	Yes. 1 hit without any tool or weapons. And could be picked up by Shift Right-Clicking at it.
	
* What is the default light level of the lanterns? Can it be change in a config file?
	11, or just slightly lower than a Torch. Yes or no. If some player decided to cheat, they're just gonna set it way high. Try setting a limit.
